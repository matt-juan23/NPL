Two bi-directional LSTM recurrent networks were chosened to train the model. 
The first RNN is a binary classification network for rating and the second RNN is a multi-class classification for review catagory.

Reasons for selecting LSTM:
From observing the dataset, we noticed that most sentences have long range dependency, which means
